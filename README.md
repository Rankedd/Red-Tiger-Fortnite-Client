The End
6 years after the creation of rbxfpsunlocker, Roblox has added a Maximum Frame Rate setting to the in-game menu. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰!

For those interested in other Roblox engine tweaks (e.g. "alt-enter fix", small FPS caps), check out Bloxstrap. For those interested in experimenting with framerates higher than 240, refer to the latest build of RFU, which still allows for this in Roblox Studio as of 06/21/2024.

Thanks for using rbxfpsunlocker
